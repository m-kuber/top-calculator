# top-calculator
The final project of the TOP Foundations course, which will use all the concepts taught so far in the course to implement a working calculator.

UPDATE (01-10-2024):
The calculator has been completed, however there is a limitation that the output can be calculated only when the input from the user consists of exactly two operands with an operator in between. While this still works to a large extent and most probably won't be an issue if the user behaves ideally, there is still much room for improvement.
